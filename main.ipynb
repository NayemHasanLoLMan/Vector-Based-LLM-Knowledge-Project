He followed this up by studying  Islam and \\nArabic at the famous religious seminary of Deoband near Delhi for \\nalmost two years. Shortly after this, being attracted towards the Lahore \\nAhmadiyya Movement, he became a missionary, author and scholar of \\nthe Movement for the rest of his life.  During the 1930s h e served in \\nEngland first as deputy Imam and then as Imam of  the world-famous \\nShah Jahan Mosque at Woking and the Woking Muslim Mission. Later \\nin Lahore in 1939 he became editor of The Islamic Review, the monthly \\njournal of the Woking Muslim mission. In 1950 he was appointed as \\neditor of The Light, the English weekly organ of the Lahore Ahmad -\\niyya Movement published from Lahore, and served in this capacity till \\nhis death, while also engaged in translating Sahih Bukhari into English \\nduring this time. He also translated the well-known Sufi work Futūh al-\\nGhaib, by Hazrat Shaikh Abdul Qadir Jilani, into English.'),\n",

If I found a report to contradict the Holy Qur’ān, I \\nhave tried to interpret it in a sense which makes it accord with the \\nQur’ān. Where it proved impossible to find such an interpretation, I \\nhave rejected the report in whole or in part, as necessary. If a report \\ncould be interpreted in more than one way, I have given preference \\nto the sense which makes it accord with human experience or \\naccepted history. In case of reports which clash with each other, I \\nhave accepted that view which is supported  by the majority of \\nreports or by the stronger evidence. In writing these notes I have \\nborne in mind allegations of the critics of Islām as well as the \\ndoubts and objec tions raised in our present times due to modern \\nthought. \\nI have to confess my handicap that I lack a sufficiently broad \\nknowledge of the field of Ḥadīth. Most of all, I regret that, for the \\ntranslation of Bukhārī, I could not benefit from the vast and detailed \\nknowledge of the learned Maulana Nur -ud-Din, as I had done in \\ncase of translating the Holy Qur’ān. This regret was expressed by \\nthe Maulana himself in the last days of his life when he said to me: \\n“The Qur’ān has been done, but Bukhārī remains.” I must also \\nmention here that this shortcoming of mine has to some extent been \\nremoved by the participation of Maulana Ahmad in this work, who \\nshared with me the task of writing the footnotes.
