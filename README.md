# 🧠 Vector-Based LLM Knowledge Project – RAG with LLaMA Models + Gradio Interface

This project explores various **vector-based knowledge retrieval methods** integrated with **LLaMA models**, focusing on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It allows users to test multiple vectorization techniques, embedding models, and chunking strategies—all through a sleek **Gradio frontend**.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  Combines LLaMA-based language modeling with vector-based retrieval to enhance factual accuracy and dynamic context injection.

- 📚 **Custom Knowledge Ingestion**  
  Accepts plain text, PDF, or markdown sources, processes and stores them as **dense vector embeddings** in memory or a vector DB (e.g., FAISS or ChromaDB).

- 🧠 **LLaMA Model Integration**  
  Uses open-weight LLaMA (3.2 / 2) variants or quantized models (via HuggingFace) as the core LLM for generating rich, contextual responses.

- 🎛️ **Parameter Tuning + Testing Interface**  
  Features a **Gradio-based UI** to:
  - Upload knowledge
  - Ask questions
  - Switch between vector backends
  - Adjust RAG chunk sizes, overlap, top_k, and more

- 📈 **Experiment with Embedding Models**  
  Easily test and compare different vectorization techniques:
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `openai-embeddings`
  - `llamaindex`, `langchain`, etc.


# 🧪 Sample Use Case

1. Upload a PDF of a technical whitepaper.

2. System ingests and vectorizes content.

3. Ask a question like:
    - "What is the core difference between LLaMA 2 and 3.2?"

4. RAG retrieves relevant chunks → LLaMA model generates a detailed answer.




# 🛠️ Tech Stack

    Component | Technology
    LLM | LLaMA 3.2 / HuggingFace models
    Embeddings | Sentence-Transformers, OpenAI
    Vector DB | FAISS / Chroma / In-Memory

# ⚙️ Setup Instructions
 1. Clone the Repository

        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vector-llama-rag.git
        cd vector-llama-rag




# 🧠 Customization Options



- 🔧 Modify chunk_utils.py to change chunk size, overlap strategy.
- 🧪 Plug in different models in embedder.py for experimentation.
- 📚 Point vector_store.py to a remote or persistent vector DB.
- 🧩 Add LangChain agents for advanced memory/chaining.




# 📈 Roadmap
